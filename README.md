# Micro-frontend

This example demos a basic host application loading remote component.

- `main` is the host application.
- `header` standalone application which exposes `Search` component.
- `form` standalone application which exposes `Button, Text` component.

# Running Demo

Install `node_modules` in each application and Run `npm start`.

Run the `main` application firdt then run remote application one by one to see how it works.

- [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) (Main)
- [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/) (Header)
- [localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002/) (Form)
